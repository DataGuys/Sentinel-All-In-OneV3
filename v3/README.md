# Microsoft Sentinel All-In-One V3: Cost-Optimized Deployment

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel All-In-One V3 introduces advanced cost optimization features to help organizations effectively manage their security monitoring costs while maintaining comprehensive threat detection capabilities. This guide explains the key cost-saving features and how to implement them effectively.

## Key Cost Optimization Features

### Multi-Tier Storage

Sentinel V3 leverages Azure Log Analytics multi-tier storage to optimize costs:

1. **Standard Tier**: For critical security data that requires frequent querying and real-time analytics.
2. **Auxiliary Tier**: For less critical data that doesn't need to be queried as frequently but is still important for security operations.
3. **Basic Tier**: For data that needs to be retained for compliance purposes but is rarely queried.

### Data Collection Optimization

Sentinel V3 uses Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to provide more granular control over what data is collected:

1. **Entra ID Optimization**: Fine-tune collection of high-volume logs like NonInteractiveSignIn logs.
2. **Corelight Network Data Optimization**: Configure different tiers for different types of Corelight data based on security value.

### Industry-Specific Configurations

Sentinel V3 provides industry-specific content:

1. **Industry Query Packs**: Pre-built queries tailored to specific industries like Healthcare, Financial Services, Government, etc.
2. **Tiering Recommendations**: Industry-specific recommendations for which data to put in which tier.

### Cost Monitoring Dashboard

A specialized workbook provides visibility into your Sentinel costs:

1. **Ingestion Tracking**: Track daily ingestion volumes by data source and type.
2. **Cost Projections**: Project future costs based on current usage patterns.
3. **Optimization Recommendations**: Get actionable recommendations to further reduce costs.

## Best Practices for Cost Optimization

1. **Right-Size Your Retention Periods**: Only keep data for as long as you need it. Use different retention periods for different data types.
2. **Leverage Tiered Storage**: Move high-volume, lower-security-value data to Auxiliary or Basic tiers.
3. **Implement Filtering at Collection**: Use DCRs to filter out unnecessary data before it is ingested.
4. **Monitor Costs Regularly**: Review the cost dashboard weekly to identify trends and opportunities for optimization.
5. **Use Query Optimization**: Write efficient KQL queries that minimize data scanned.

## Implementing Cost Controls

### Setting Up Data Tiers

During deployment, you can configure:

1. **Tier-Specific Retention**: Define different retention periods for each tier.
2. **Table-Specific Settings**: Configure individual tables to use the appropriate tier.

### Configuring Entra ID Cost Optimization

1. **NonInteractive Sign-In Optimization**: Move these high-volume logs to Auxiliary tier.
2. **Service Principal Optimization**: Configure filtering for service principal logs.

### Setting Up Corelight Cost Controls

1. **Value-Based Tiering**: Configure high-value tables (DNS, HTTP, SSL) for Standard tier.
2. **Volume-Based Optimization**: Move high-volume, lower-value tables to cost-optimized tiers.

## Monitoring and Ongoing Optimization

Use the built-in cost monitoring dashboard to:

1. **Track Ingestion Trends**: Monitor daily ingestion by data source.
2. **Identify Cost Drivers**: Find which data sources are driving the most cost.
3. **Act on Recommendations**: Implement the suggested optimizations in the dashboard.
