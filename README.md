Key Cost Optimization Features
Multi-Tier Storage
Sentinel V3 leverages Azure Log Analytics multi-tier storage to optimize costs:

Standard Tier: For critical security data requiring frequent querying and real-time analytics
Auxiliary Tier: For less critical data that doesn't need to be queried as frequently
Basic Tier: For data that needs to be retained for compliance purposes but is rarely queried

Data Collection Optimization
Gain more granular control over what data is collected with:

Entra ID Optimization: Fine-tune collection of high-volume logs like NonInteractiveSignIn logs
Corelight Network Data Optimization: Configure different tiers for different types of network data based on security value
Intelligent Data Collection Rules (DCRs): Filter data before ingestion to reduce costs

## Industry-Specific Configurations

Industry Query Packs: Pre-built queries tailored to specific industries including Healthcare, Financial Services, Government, and more
Tiering Recommendations: Industry-specific guidance for which data to place in each storage tier
Customized Detection Rules: Security content aligned with industry-specific threats and compliance requirements

## Cost Monitoring Dashboard
A specialized workbook provides visibility into your Sentinel costs:

Ingestion Tracking: Monitor daily ingestion volumes by data source and type
Cost Projections: Project future costs based on current usage patterns
Optimization Recommendations: Get actionable recommendations to further reduce costs
Table Management: Interactive interface to adjust storage tiers and retention periods

# Architecture Overview
## Microsoft Sentinel All-In-One V3 deploys:

After deployment completes, access your new Sentinel workspace and the cost optimization dashboard

Best Practices for Cost Optimization

Right-Size Your Retention Periods: Only keep data for as long as you need it
Leverage Tiered Storage: Move high-volume, lower-security-value data to Auxiliary or Basic tiers
Implement Filtering at Collection: Use DCRs to filter out unnecessary data before ingestion
Monitor Costs Regularly: Review the cost dashboard weekly to identify optimization opportunities
Use Query Optimization: Write efficient KQL queries that minimize data scanned

Customization Options
The deployment offers several customization options:

Data Connectors: Choose which Microsoft and third-party data sources to enable
Solutions: Select from Microsoft 1st party solutions and essentials content
Storage Tiers: Configure retention periods and storage tiers for different data types
Industry Settings: Deploy specialized content for your industry vertical
Analytics Rules: Enable scheduled rules filtered by severity level
